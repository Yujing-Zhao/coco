# coco
my coco for yolov5


If you have run my first repository,SVHN_yolo
You need to modify your code to run this dataset:
At SVHN_yolo/yolov5/data/mycoco.yaml
Mark train path from "../mycoco/images/train/" to "../coco/images/train"
The same applies to another file path,from "../mycoco/images/val/" to "../coco/images/val"

Finally,please ensure that the dataset folder and yolov5 folder are in the same directory
